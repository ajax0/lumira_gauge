# lumira_gauge
An open-source Gauge extension for SAP Lumira

This extension expects the following files in your source data:
  Position 1: Key - this is the metric name and will be used to label each gauge;
  Position 2: Value - this is the actual number that is used by the dial;
  Position 3: Min - this is the minimum value for the gauge scale;
  Position 4: Max - this is the maximum value for the gauge scale;
  Position 5: LiH - this is a 'low is high' indicator (1: high zone is green, or 0: high zone is red) to control the 'high' colour range.
